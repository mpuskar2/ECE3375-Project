# Door Control System - ECE3375 Final Project
* Door locking mechanism that uses a NFC scanner to unlock/lock a door
* Assembly code for the project
* Prototype created to be run on a DE10-Standard board
* Uses the board's built in JTAG UART to simulate the NFC scanner connected via UART
* Outputs the door's state (locked or unlocked) to the GPIO port to be read by the LEDs and locking mechanism
